You look up the tree, put your hand on the trunk and feel all the lovers engravings upon it. Your fingers feels every bump.
There's a shop right next to the tree, that fits the description. On the windowsill there are some garlic pots. And there is no sign, 
but it is very clear it's the right shop

You get inside, the place looks like a combination of a tea house, and a book store. There is this sweet scenet in the air, a warm oaky scent.
"Hello there, I'm the Pourer."
You hear a voice, chirping like small bells
"It's seems you are in need for some tea.

There is a person, coming from the back of the tea-book-house. The person looks like they got out of a 19th century oil painting.
You are starteld with the voice, you didn't expect this.
In order to choose the right tea for you, I need to ask you some questions.

You stand in front of them, surprised, blinking.
