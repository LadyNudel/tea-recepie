You turn left - you walk through the cemetry.
Although the sky is gray, the cemetery dosen't feel as gloomy as usual, it feels...calm? and somehow pretty, the rain washed away all the dust.
You always thought it was a bit of a mess, the cemetery. There are a few enteries into this place, and the graves are not in any particual order.
There is this one grave you visit when you are next to the cemetery. The name was earesed years ago, and you have no idea who's is it.
Yet, you always put a small rock on it.
