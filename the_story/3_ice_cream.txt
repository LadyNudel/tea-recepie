You turn right - you walk through the park.
There are some still rain drops hanging from the branches. There are some cycelists, and skaters on the way.
'There are a few ways to get to the shop', you remember the person saying. 'And you really want to drink some magickal tea' they added.
Suddenly you feel all light and full of energy.
