Happy with your purches, you get closer to the oak tree. It's been almost an hour since you got out, and it's getting colder.
You snuggle in your coat, and you see less and less people out. It's seems as if the cold drives up poeple back to their homes.
There is this big graffiti wall, you pass it every time you go to work. You alway like looking at it, hoping to see a new painting.
You look at the wall, and see nothing new, at least the rain didn't wash away the paintings. 
Finally, you get to the tree.
